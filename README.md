## Music Genre Recognition

1. Download the fma_small dataset from https://github.com/mdeff/fma

2. Save the folders which are named as '000','001', etc containing the audio files in a folder called ./music_samples/ as the processing functions look for that folder.

3. Run the load_audio.py file to extract and save the melspectrogram and the audio features (we don't use this directly in our code.)

4. Run the training and testing on the dataset by running: python models.py
